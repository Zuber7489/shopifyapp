## ðŸ›  **Setup Instructions**

### **Option 1: Using Metafields (Recommended)**

#### **Step 1: Create Metafields in Shopify Admin**

Go to **Settings > Custom data > Metafields** and create these metafields:

**For Products:**
```
Namespace: custom
Key: capacity
Type: Single line text
Description: Product capacity (e.g., "20L", "24L")

Namespace: custom
Key: dimensions
Type: Single line text
Description: Product dimensions (e.g., "19\" x 15\" x 4\"")

Namespace: custom
Key: weight
Type: Single line text
Description: Product weight (e.g., "2.5lbs")

Namespace: custom
Key: fabric
Type: Single line text
Description: Fabric type (e.g., "420D Cordura Polycarbonate Nylon")

Namespace: custom
Key: features
Type: List of single line text
Description: Product features (comma-separated)

Namespace: custom
Key: silicon_coating
Type: Multi-line text
Description: Silicon face coating description

Namespace: custom
Key: coal_pu_coating
Type: Multi-line text
Description: Coal PU backside description

Namespace: custom
Key: overview
Type: Multi-line text
Description: Product overview and aesthetic description
```

#### **Step 2: Fill Metafields for Each Product**

For each product, add the metafield values:

**Example for Commuter Pack 20L:**
```
Capacity: 20L
Dimensions: 19" x 15" x 4"
Weight: 2.5lbs
Fabric: 420D Cordura Polycarbonate Nylon
Features: Water Bottle Pocket, Laptop Pocket, Trolley Sleeve, Carry-On Size, Phone Pocket, Waterproof, Zippers, Tech Caddy
Silicon Coating: Provides extreme weather, strain abrasion resistance without changing the look and hand feel of the fabric.
Coal PU Coating: Makes the fabric waterproof and also weldable which allows the seams of the bag to be bonded for additional weather resistance.
Overview: Has a modern technical aesthetic with a smooth supple feel. Has slightly more structure than our ballistic version, without being stiff and rigid like many PU and TPU coated fabrics. It's the ideal choice for adventure enthusiast that want a hybrid option to transition between office and outdoors.
```

**Example for Commuter Pack 24L:**
```
Capacity: 24L
Dimensions: 19" x 15" x 4"
Weight: 2.5lbs
Fabric: 840D Cordura Ballistic Nylon
Features: Water Bottle Pocket, Laptop Pocket, Trolley Sleeve, Carry-On Size, Phone Pocket, Hidden Passport Pocket, Waterproof, Zippers, Tech Caddy
Silicon Coating: Provides extreme weather, strain abrasion resistance without changing the look and hand feel of the fabric.
Coal PU Coating: Makes the fabric waterproof and also weldable which allows the seams of the bag to be bonded for additional weather resistance.
Overview: A timeless aesthetic and classic ballistic hand feel that has a fine grid-like texture that's subtly slick to the touch. It strikes the perfect balance to maintain some structure to prevent that floppy saggin look, while not being stiff and rigid. It's the ideal choice for purists seeking a refined, ultra-lux look that's office appropriate.
```

### **Option 2: Using Product Tags (Alternative)**

If you prefer using tags, add these tags to your products:

**For Features:**
- `water-bottle-pocket`
- `laptop-pocket`
- `trolley-sleeve`
- `carry-on`
- `phone-pocket`
- `passport-pocket`
- `waterproof`
- `zippers`
- `tech-caddy`

**For Specs:**
- `capacity-20L`
- `capacity-24L`
- `dimensions-19x15x4`
- `weight-2.5lbs`
- `fabric-420d-cordura`
- `fabric-840d-ballistic`

## ðŸ”§ **Advanced Configuration**

### **Custom Collection for Comparison**

Create a specific collection for products that should appear in the compare modal:

1. Go to **Products > Collections**
2. Create a new collection called "Compare Bags"
3. Add the products you want to compare
4. Update the snippet to use this collection:

```liquid
{% assign compare_collection = collections['compare-bags'] %}
```

### **Dynamic Color Mapping**

To show actual color swatches, create a color mapping metafield:

```
Namespace: custom
Key: color_swatches
Type: List of single line text
Description: Color hex codes (e.g., "#000000,#1a2c2c,#666666")
```

Then update the JavaScript to use these colors:

```javascript
// In the colors generation section
const colorSwatches = prod.colorSwatches ? prod.colorSwatches.split(',') : ['#000000'];
const colorsHtml = colorSwatches.map(color => 
  `<div class="compare-modal-color" style="background-color: ${color.trim()}"></div>`
).join('');
```

### **Fabric-Specific Comparison**

For fabric comparison, you can create separate tabs or sections:

```javascript
function renderFabricComparison() {
  const fabricData = products.map(prod => ({
    fabric: prod.fabric,
    techSpecs: prod.techSpecs,
    overview: prod.overview
  }));
  
  // Render fabric-specific comparison
}
```
