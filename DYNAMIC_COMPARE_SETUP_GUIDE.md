## üîß **Shopify Metafields Setup**

### **1. Required Metafields (All Rich Text Editor Type)**

Go to **Settings > Custom data > Products > Add definition** and create these metafields:

| **Metafield Name** | **Type** | **Description** | **Example Content** |
|-------------------|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| `capacity` | Rich text editor | Product capacity/size | `20L` |
| `dimensions` | Rich text editor | Product dimensions | `19" x 18" x 4"` |
| `weight` | Rich text editor | Product weight | `2.5lbs` |
| `fabric` | Rich text editor | Fabric/material description | `420D Cordura Polycarbonate Nylon` |
| `features` | Rich text editor | Product features (comma-separated) | `Water bottle pocket, Luggage pass through, Laptop compartment, Carry handle, Water proof, Zippers, Tech caddy` |
| `tech_specs` | Rich text editor | **Combined tech specs** (both silicon coating & coal PU) | `Silicon Face Coating: This coating provides extreme weather, strain abrasion resistance without changing the look and hand feel of the fabric. Coal PU Backside: This coating makes the fabric waterproof and also weldable which allows the seams of the bag to be bonded for additional weather resistance.` |
| `overview` | Rich text editor | Product overview/description | `Modern technical aesthetic with a smooth supple feel. More structure than our ballistic version, ideal for adventure enthusiasts that want a hybrid option to transition between office and outdoors.` |

### **2. Variant-Specific Metafields (Optional)**

For more detailed size-specific information, you can also create variant-level metafields:

| **Metafield Name** | **Type** | **Scope** | **Description** |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| `dimensions` | Rich text editor | Variant | Size-specific dimensions |
| `weight` | Rich text editor | Variant | Size-specific weight |
| `features` | Rich text editor | Variant | Size-specific features |
| `tech_specs` | Rich text editor | Variant | Size-specific tech specs |
| `overview` | Rich text editor | Variant | Size-specific overview |

**Note**: If variant-level metafields are not set, the system will fall back to product-level metafields.

### **3. Fabric Variants Setup**

For fabric comparison to work, create product variants with fabric options:

**Variant Structure:**
- **Option 1**: Size (20L, 24L, 30L, etc.)
- **Option 2**: Fabric (Carbonate, Ballistic Nylon, Cordura, etc.)

**Example Variants:**
- Commuter Pack 20L Carbonate
- Commuter Pack 20L Ballistic Nylon
- Commuter Pack 24L Carbonate
- Commuter Pack 24L Ballistic Nylon

**Fabric Detection**: The system automatically detects fabric variants by looking for:
- `option2` containing "Fabric", "fabric", "Carbonate", "Ballistic", "Nylon", "Cordura"
